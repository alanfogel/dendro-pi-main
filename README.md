# 🌲 Dendro-Pi Monitoring System

This project sets up a Raspberry Pi to monitor dendrometers and take periodic images, then uploads data to Dropbox for long-term analysis at research sites.

My other projects that build on this initial setup:
- [Charge Controller](https://github.com/alanfogel/ChargeController)
- Dendrometer Logger - *Under construction...*

The default behaviour of this system is to take a picture at 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM, and 6:00 PM every day, and upload the pictures each night to a Dropbox folder named after the Pi's hostname (e.g., `Dorval-8`).

## ⚙️ Initial Setup: Flashing the Pi SD Card

1. Insert SD card into your computer.
2. Download and open [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
3. Configure with the following:
   - **Device**: Raspberry Pi Zero ***(Not Zero 2 W)***
   - **OS**: Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 32-bit) (Bookworm)
   - **Storage**: Select Storage (Mass Storage Device USB Device)
   ### - Edit settings
   - **Hostname**: e.g., `Dorval-8`
   - **Username/Password** (To log into the Pi): `madlab` / `______`
   - **Wi-Fi SSID/Password**: `new_aspen_2022` / `___________`
   - **Country**: CA
   - **Enable SSH**: Use password authentication
4. Write

5. When done, insert the SD card into your Pi and power it up.

## 🔌 Connect & Configure the Raspberry Pi

1. Connect your laptop to the same Wi-Fi as the Pi.
2. Open terminal (or PowerShell) and SSH into your Pi:
   ```bash
   ssh madlab@Dorval-8.local # ssh username@{hostname}.local
   ```
   if cannot resolve the hostname, use the IP address:
   ```bash
   nslookup Dorval-8.local # to find the IP address
   ssh madlab@{IP_ADDRESS} # ssh username@{IP_ADDRESS}
   ```
3. Run:
    ```bash
    sudo raspi-config
    ```
    - Set timezone under Localization Options
    - Reboot the Pi
4. After reboot, SSH in again and test the camera:
   ```bash
   rpicam-jpeg -o test.jpg
   ```
   - If not found, install:
   ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-picamera2 python3-picamera2
   ``` 

## 📦 Installing dendro-pi Scripts

1. Clone the project:
````bash
git clone https://github.com/alanfogel/dendro-pi-main.git
cd dendro-pi-main
````
2. Enter test folder and try:
```bash
cd test
python test_camera.py
```
3. Edit your camera name in main/dendro_pictures.py on this line: ```CAMERA_NAME = "DorvalTest"```
- (Replace `Dorval-8_` with your camera name):
```bash
cd ..
nano main/dendro_pictures.py
```
```python
CAMERA_NAME = "Dorval-8_" # the trailing underscore is important for namining the files
```

## ☁️ Configure Dropbox Upload

1. In the root project directory ```~/dendro-pi-main/```:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alanfogel/Dropbox-Uploader.git
cd Dropbox-Uploader
sudo chmod +x dropbox_uploader.sh
```
```bash
./dropbox_uploader.sh
```
- At the end of the output of the above command, it will ask for the “App key”
- Go to the Dropbox app developer url and login with your Dropbox account, a screen will appear having a “Create an app” button, and a list of Apps created with your account. Select “DendroPictures”
-	Under the settings tab - Scroll down and you will find the “App key” and “App secret”, note down them and return back to the terminal
-	In the terminal enter the codes when promted, (when you enter the “App secret”, then it will give you a link, visiting it, you will get the “Access code”), once all the information is provided you will link with your dropbox cloud.

2. Update upload-to-dropbox.sh:
```bash
cd ..
nano upload-to-dropbox.sh
```
Modify the variable declaration line (Replace `Dorval-8` with your Dropbox folder name):
```bash
DROPBOX_PATH="/Dorval-8/"
```

3. Ensure UNIX line endings:
```bash
dos2unix upload-to-dropbox.sh
```

## 📝 Centralized Error Logging

Run the logging installer to set up system‑wide error and event logging:

```bash
cd logging
./install.sh

## 🕓 Setup Crontab
1. Open crontab and save immediately:
```bash
crontab -e
```

2. Check if its empty:
```bash
crontab -l
```
3. If it's not empty, run:
```bash
crontab -r
```
4. Install scheduled jobs: **TODO: FIX ADD_CRON.sh**
```bash
sh add_cron.sh
```
5. Confirm:
```bash
crontab -l
```
6. You can edit the crontab file to change the schedule (like staggering the uploads):
```bash
crontab -e
```

## ✅ Test Setup
```bash
# Take a picture
cd main
python dendro_pictures.py

# Upload pictures
cd ..
bash upload-to-dropbox.sh
```
- Check Dropbox for uploaded files.


## 📁 Copying Pictures from Pi to PC

From your Windows machine:

```powershell
scp -r madlab@Dorval8.local:~/dendro-pi-main/pictures C:\Users\alanj\Desktop
```
- Replace `Dorval8.local` with your Pi's hostname.
- Replace `C:\Users\alanj\Desktop` with your desired local directory.
